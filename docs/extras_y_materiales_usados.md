Materials and tools used

Here I'm going to describe the materials and tools we used in the project, as well as purchase links.

## Materials

- **Electrical tape**, you've seen we use it for almost everything since it's cheap and lets us hold things easily. I buy the following pack that includes tapes of various colors [Link to product](https://amzn.to/4n7i74Y)

- **Isopropyl alcohol**, this was used for cleaning the inside of the TV, as it doesn't react with electronic components or leave residue. I have a 5L jug and refill a 1L bottle as I use it up [Link to product](https://amzn.to/4mIcNW5)

- **Paper towels**, used for cleaning. In my case, I buy them at the supermarket, so I'm not including a link as you can find them at a good price in any neighborhood store.

- **Thermal paste**, although little was used, I'm adding it as a recommendation. I always use this one; it's good, cheap, and works well [Link to product](https://amzn.to/3USUi4U)

- **Heat shrink tubing**, used when we had to extend the power supply cable. I think it's one of the things I use most in my workshop. In my case, I buy boxes like the one in the link that include all shapes since the color doesn't usually matter to me [Link to product](https://amzn.to/3VoK8ZU)

- **Double-sided tape**, I buy it directly from my city's hardware store but I'm seeing it's cheaper on Amazon. Use it carefully, it sticks strongly [Link to product](https://amzn.to/41u1tnZ)

- **PAM8403 amplifier**, this was bought on AliExpress, because 10 units cost me 2 euros and it's good to have them for projects [Link to product](https://es.aliexpress.com/item/1005006012531320.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.3.1d253525vLpV8I&algo_pvid=2435cee0-0af3-4374-936c-29a7f4b0727f&algo_exp_id=2435cee0-0af3-4374-936c-29a7f4b0727f-2&pdp_ext_f=%7B%22order%22%3A%22484%22%2C%22eval%22%3A%221%22%7D&pdp_npi=6%40dis%21EUR%215.39%210.99%21%21%2143.69%218.00%21%40210391a017565829109768946edf08%2112000035329868684%21sea%21ES%210%21ABX%211%210%21n_tag%3A-29910%3Bd%3Aa90a8680%3Bm03_new_user%3A-29895%3BpisId%3A5000000174047507&curPageLogUid=QI1yTYA78EnF&utparam-url=scene%3Asearch%7Cquery_from%3A%7Cx_object_id%3A1005006012531320%7C_p_origin_prod%3A)

- **Glue**, used to re-glue the speaker to the TV. I'd say any super glue would work. I used the following one because it's what I had on hand. I normally use Supergen but I had run out [Link to product](https://amzn.to/3I1Mg6V) | [Supergen](https://amzn.to/3JG8yf1)

- **Solder and flux**, two basics for soldering. Here I'm going to recommend always using leaded solder. Although it's more expensive (and slightly more toxic), it's a thousand times better to solder with. For flux, I always try to use a paste and apply it with a spatula or cotton swab [Solder](https://amzn.to/4p1bD9D) | [Flux](https://amzn.to/45HoiHi)

- **Cable Velcro**, this was used for cable organization even though you can't see it in the images. I bought it for the workshop and it ended up being great for the project [Link to product](https://amzn.to/3UT4z12)

## Tools

- **Dremel**, as you can see, it was used for a lot in the project. It's a tool I highly recommend having because it saves you from a thousand things due to how versatile it is. As for replacement tips, you can buy generic ones. I have a kit from Parkside (Lidl) [Link to product](https://amzn.to/4n6cmEL)

- **Scart to AV adapter**, in my case we bought it at the Chinese store because we needed it urgently, but it cost us the same as the one I'm linking to on Amazon and it's the same one, go figure. It's great because it allows you to use it for both video input and output [Link to product](https://amzn.to/41u5kRS)

- **Soldering iron**, this is an essential in every electronics project. I recommend the following JBC one because I've had it for several years and it has never given me any problems [Link to product](https://amzn.to/4lSGN07)

- **Brush**, I bought them at a paint store, but for the price I paid for one brush, I realize I could have bought three [Link to product](https://amzn.to/45Fd464)

## PC Components

All the components were recycled parts I had in the workshop, but I'm listing their characteristics as well as a purchase / information link for them.

- **Intel Core i7-950** [Wikipedia](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Core_i7_(Nehalem))
- **8Gb DDR3 RAM**, I don't know the brand of the module used, [Link to product](https://amzn.to/41shivs)
- **Nvidia GeForce 7300GT 256MB** [Technical City](https://technical.city/es/video/GeForce-7300-GT)
- **Seagate 500GB 2.5" HDD**, I had the hard drive in the workshop but this is the exact one [Link to product](https://amzn.to/4fX97No)
- **Power supply and network card**, the network card is a pretty old Dlink Wi-Fi 4 but it's what we had, and the power supply is one I had in the workshop from the OEM ones that come with pre-built computers. I'm linking to two alternatives to the ones we used [Power supply](https://amzn.to/3VoYKIL) | [Network card](https://amzn.to/47fi42u)
- **Asus P6T Motherboard** [Asus](https://www.asus.com/es/supportonly/p6t/helpdesk_knowledge/)

## Recommendation
I recommend using a Raspberry Pi and a hat with analog output like the RGBberry, although there are other options and models.
[Raspberry Pi 4B](https://amzn.to/4n6wV3M) + [RGBerry](https://www.osaelectronics.com/product/rgberry-scart/)

With this combination, not only do you save yourself the problems we had, but you can also install a system like Recalbox with everything ready to use.
