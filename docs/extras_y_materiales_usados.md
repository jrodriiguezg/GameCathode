# The Workshop Arsenal: Tools and Materials

Every good "maker" knows that behind every project there's an arsenal of tools and a handful of key materials. Here we break down everything we used to bring the GameCathode to life, from the electronic components to the consumables that got us out of more than one tight spot.

## Workshop Materials

These are the basic consumables and components that formed the backbone of the assembly.

- **Electrical Tape:** Our Swiss Army knife for fastening. We used it for almost everything: organizing cables, temporary fixes... An indispensable classic. This [multicolor pack](https://amzn.to/4n7i74Y) always comes in handy.
- **Isopropyl Alcohol:** The elixir of cleaning for electronics. Essential for making the inside of the TV look new again without damaging any components. Buying a [large jug](https://amzn.to/4mIcNW5) and refilling a small bottle is the best strategy.
- **Thermal Paste:** Although it was a small touch-up, changing the thermal paste is crucial for the longevity of the processor. We always use one that offers good value for money like [this one](https://amzn.to/3USUi4U).
- **Heat Shrink Tubing:** The professional solution for extending the power supply cables. A [varied kit](https://amzn.to/3VoK8ZU) is pure gold in any electronics workshop.
- **Double-Sided Tape:** For those fixes that need to be strong from the get-go. We used it for the initial power supply mounting. Be careful, because [it really sticks](https://amzn.to/41u1tnZ)!
- **PAM8403 Amplifier:** The little giant that gave voice to the project. Bought on [AliExpress](https://es.aliexpress.com/item/1005006012531320.html) for a ridiculously low price, it's perfect for adding stereo sound to any invention.
- **Instant Glue:** To put the speaker back in its place, a good [super glue](https://amzn.to/3I1Mg6V) is the solution. Although our preference is usually [Supergen](https://amzn.to/3JG8yf1) for its resistance.
- **Solder and Flux:** No soldering without them. We recommend using [leaded solder](https://amzn.to/4p1bD9D) (with caution) because it's so easy to work with, and [paste flux](https://amzn.to/45HoiHi) for clean and durable joints.
- **Velcro for Cables:** The final touch for decent cable management. Although you can't see it in all the photos, this [Velcro](https://amzn.to/3UT4z12) helped us organize everything.
- **Paper Towels:** The unsung hero of the cleaning phase. No link needed, your local store is your best supplier!

## Key Tools

These are the tools that did the heavy lifting and allowed us to adapt, cut, and connect.

- **Dremel (or similar):** The star of the project. Without it, it would have been impossible to make the cuts in the case for the motherboard and connectors. A [multi-purpose tool](https://amzn.to/4n6cmEL) is one of the best investments for a workshop.
- **SCART to AV Adapter:** The translator that connected two eras. We found it in a local store out of urgency, but it's identical to [this one on Amazon](https://amzn.to/41u5kRS). Its ability to be both an input or output makes it very versatile.
- **Soldering Iron:** The heart of any electronics work. A good soldering iron like the [JBC](https://amzn.to/4lSGN07) is a tool for life.
- **Brushes:** To remove the decades of dust accumulated inside the TV. An [economical set](https://amzn.to/45Fd464) is more than enough.

## The Heart of the System: PC Components

All the PC components were recycled parts we had in the workshop, proving that you don't need the latest and greatest to create something incredible.

- **CPU:** Intel Core i7-950. A veteran that still has a lot to say. [More info on Wikipedia](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Core_i7_(Nehalem)).
- **Motherboard:** Asus P6T. The backbone that ties everything together. [Asus support](https://www.asus.com/es/supportonly/p6t/helpdesk_knowledge/).
- **RAM:** 8 GB of DDR3 RAM. Enough to run the system and emulators smoothly. [A similar module](https://amzn.to/41shivs).
- **Graphics Card:** Nvidia GeForce 7300 GT (256MB). The key to the project thanks to its composite video (AV) output. [Technical details](https://technical.city/es/video/GeForce-7300-GT).
- **Storage:** A 500 GB 2.5" Seagate hard drive. An [old acquaintance](https://amzn.to/4fX97No) we had saved for an occasion like this.
- **Power Supply and WiFi:** We used a generic power supply and an old D-Link WiFi card. For anyone looking for alternatives, here's an [affordable power supply](https://amzn.to/3VoYKIL) and a [current WiFi card](https://amzn.to/47fi42u).

## An Alternative Route: The Raspberry Pi Path

If we had to start from scratch or wanted a more compact solution, we would definitely explore this route.

Using a [Raspberry Pi 4B](https://amzn.to/4n6wV3M) along with a "hat" with analog video output like the [RGBerry](https://www.osaelectronics.com/product/rgberry-scart/) would greatly simplify the project. You save yourself the challenges of space, power, and ventilation that we had, and you can install systems like Recalbox or RetroPie almost automatically.
