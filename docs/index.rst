Welcome to the GameCathode creation documentation.
=============================================

This project was born with the idea of reviving old tube televisions,
transforming them into a retro emulation center.

One of the first options was a **Raspberry Pi 4 4GB** + Recalbox, but
we had problems when using the AV video output. We tried changing
the OS, but it wasn't quite what we were looking for, because we needed a complete
emulation center and the Raspberry Pi limited us by not being able to run some systems
 (**Dolphin**).

The second option, and the one that was ultimately used, is **old but functional PC hardware
**. All of the parts are recycled from the workshop. In this case, the
configuration is as follows:

- 1st generation Intel Core i7
- 8 GB DDR3
- Nvidia GeForce 7300 256MB (the only graphics card available with AV video output)
- A 500GB HDD hard drive
- DLink WiFi card
- 300W Chinese power supply

For the TV, we used a Minerva MT 5511, about which there is hardly any
information on the Internet.

**Why GameCathode?**
   The name combines the two things on which the project is based: **Game** for the games and **Cathode** 
   for the technology used by TVs of that era
